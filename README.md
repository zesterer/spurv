# Spurv

A free, open-source CPU and instruction set specification with a minimalist design

## What?

Spurv is a free, open-source CPU specification. It aims to be embrace the philosophies of minimalism, modularity, and many other aspects of the [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). It does so with a simple, extensible instruction set that is easy to debug, easy to design hardware for, and easy to port existing software to. The instruction set attempts to embody the RISC principle: simplicity is better and complexity is the enemy of clarity.

## Why?

In an age of spyware, [critical CPU bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)), and unaccountable closed 'guardware' such as the [Intel ME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine), it's time to reel in the control that large corporations have over the computing industry and, increasingly, our lives. It's an unavoidable fact that the future of society lies with technology, and its crowning jewel - the microprocessor - will be the pinnacle of this revolution.

Yet while hardware so integral to the future of the human race remains hidden by private juggernauts, we will forever be enslaved by their interests. Private hardware specifications and closed-source development flies directly in the face of that which comes intuitively to anyone that knows anything about politics: democracy **requires** accountability, and accountability can only be achieved through transparency and public pressure.

No government will act as a bastion against such interests. No government would do such a thing without being required to do so by public demand. It is time control of consumer electronics returned to the people that should have control over them: the consumers.
